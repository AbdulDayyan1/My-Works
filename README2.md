 Weather Monitoring System

## Overview

The Weather Monitoring System is a real-time data processing application that monitors weather conditions using the OpenWeatherMap API. It provides users with detailed weather information, including daily summaries, temperature visualizations, and alerts for specific weather conditions.

## Features

- Real-time weather data retrieval
- Daily weather summaries including average, maximum, and minimum temperatures
- Visual representation of temperature changes using line charts
- User-friendly interface built with React

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Python (v3.6 or later)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or later)

## API Key

To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you will need an API key. You can get your API key by signing up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). Once you have your key, replace the placeholder in `weather.py` with your actual API key.

```python
API_KEY = "0d5776e26aa6c0960bf7499b5a3e3ee7" #this is my api key you can use yours
